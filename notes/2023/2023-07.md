Notes

- Stephen: Error handling was the main topic from the Relay folks - they're big
  on Fragment Modularity, and using those as error boundaries. They seem like
  they'd be okay with us moving forward. Just want to make sure that we don't
  break any future improvements in fragment modularity. We can't do much more on
  that front with GraphQL as it stands today.
- Alex: So CCN errors in the standard errors array?
- Calvin: we should ensure people are okay with this.
- Stephen: and be explicit exactly what we are agreeing to.
- Alex: null propagation rules. Benjie do you remember?
- Benjie: nopeâ€¦ I think it was between just changing the nullability as-is or
  making everything between a `?` and a `!` non-nullable.
- Stephen: current status is it bubbles until it hits an optional.
- https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1009#discussioncomment-3341916
- [discussion not captured; see YouTube instead]
  - **ACTION** - Benjie: sync the video to YouTube
- [GraphQL.js PRs need attention from the GraphQL.js reviewers]
- Alex: there's an issue where a second pass over the tree was required, but
  I've done a new implementation that doesn't require that.
- Calvin: this was pegged against GraphQL v16, but v17 is in alpha now - should
  we be continuing against v16 or v17?
- Benjie: I think you should always base it off the main branch, and if it makes
  sense to backport it to v16 once it is merged then that can be arranged.
- Alex: GraphQL.js, Apollo iOS and iOS Codegen (Apollo)
- Calvin: this seems to have got far and didn't stall for technical reasons
- Alex: yeah, I changed jobs
- Stephen: and I've not managed to do anything on it yet
- Calvin: I'm working on Apollo-iOS, and adding incremental delivery, and I'd
  love to bring CCN with it as we upgrade to GraphQL v17.
- Stephen: Would be great to have it late stage RFC for GraphQLConf
- Alex: I think it's implemented in HotChocolate too?
- Stephen: we should present it at a meeting to move it to the next stage
- Benjie: where is the latest status
- Alex:
  - [graphql-wg/rfcs/ClientControlledNullability.md at main](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/ClientControlledNullability.md)
- Benjie: Not on-board with the try-catch behaviour. It can lead to unexpected
  outcomes
  - **ACTION**: Write up some examples clarifying the issues and seeking
    consensus.
- Alex: a lot of that came from Relay's `@required` directive
- Stephen: is there implementations of both approaches?
- Alex: I think there is if you're willing to dig through the git history
- **ACTION** - Calvin: pick a date for a WG meeting for the CCN working group
  before the next primary WG.
- **ACTION** - Benjie: set up the WG meeting on Zoom/calendar
- Stephen: we should invite Matt
- Alex: are there others? Jordan?
- Stephen: Matt said he'd represent Relay for this.
- Alex: I intend to attend the Aug 3rd meeting.
